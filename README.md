This is a small tool for doing higher order DCA. To build, run

```
cd hodca
cargo build --release
```

The binary can then be found in `hodca/target/release`. To see available options, call 

```
hodca --help
```

See the `example` folder for a small guide on how to use the tool with [Tracer](https://github.com/SideChannelMarvels/Tracer).
